# mulle-concurrent

#### ðŸ“¶ A lock- and wait-free hashtable (and an array too), written in C

**mulle-concurrent** is a library for lock- and wait-free data structures.
Wait-freeness is a desirable property for "hotly" contested data structures
in multi-threaded environments.

> Many of the ideas are taken from [Preshing on Programming: A Resizable, Concurrent Map](http://preshing.com/20160222/a-resizable-concurrent-map/).
> The definition of concurrent and wait-free are from [concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.de](http://concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.de/2013/05/lock-free-and-wait-free-definition-and.html)

## Add

**This project is a component of the [mulle-core](//github.com/mulle-core/mulle-core) library. As such you usually will *not* add or install it
individually, unless you specifically do not want to link against
`mulle-core`.**


### Add as an individual component

Use [mulle-sde](//github.com/mulle-sde) to add mulle-concurrent to your project:

``` sh
mulle-sde add github:mulle-concurrent/mulle-concurrent
```

To only add the sources of mulle-concurrent with dependency
sources use [clib](https://github.com/clibs/clib):


``` sh
clib install --out src/mulle-concurrent mulle-concurrent/mulle-concurrent
```

Add `-isystem src/mulle-concurrent` to your `CFLAGS` and compile all the sources that were downloaded with your project.


## Install

Use [mulle-sde](//github.com/mulle-sde) to build and install mulle-concurrent and all dependencies:

``` sh
mulle-sde install --prefix /usr/local \
   https://github.com/mulle-concurrent/mulle-concurrent/archive/latest.tar.gz
```

### Legacy Installation

Install the requirements:

| Requirements                                 | Description
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------
| [mulle-aba](https://github.com/mulle-concurrent/mulle-aba)             | ðŸš® A lock-free, cross-platform solution to the ABA problem

Download the latest [tar](https://github.com/mulle-concurrent/mulle-concurrent/archive/refs/tags/latest.tar.gz) or [zip](https://github.com/mulle-concurrent/mulle-concurrent/archive/refs/tags/latest.zip) archive and unpack it.

Install **mulle-concurrent** into `/usr/local` with [cmake](https://cmake.org):

``` sh
cmake -B build \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release &&
cmake --build build --config Release &&
cmake --install build --config Release
```
